# Foundations of Sovereign Cognitive Infrastructure: Technical Architecture and the Capability Lattice™

## Executive Summary

This document presents a comprehensive technical architecture for building sovereign cognitive infrastructure that enables operator sovereignty through the integration of knowledge management, deterministic artificial intelligence, and hardware-native virtualization. The Axiom Hive workstation represents a new paradigm in local computational environments, designed to provide an uncompromised environment for functional cognition and economic coordination.

## Key Components

### The Logic-Compute Decoupling
- Separation of application logic from inference compute
- Persistent background processes for headless operation
- Stateful REST APIs for efficient multi-step workflows

### The Forge Layer
- Type 1 bare-metal hypervisor architecture
- Hardware-native virtualization with microvisor isolation
- Xen and KVM implementation strategies

### The Raptor Engine
- Deterministic AI with functional base models
- DPO and IPO fine-tuning for non-anthropomorphic alignment
- Grammar-constrained decoding for imperative outputs

### The Nest Layer
- ZFS-based storage with data integrity guarantees
- Hierarchical knowledge store architecture
- Consistent snapshots and performance optimization

### The Hunt Layer
- Web ingestion and proactive monitoring
- VXLAN networking for logical isolation
- Mesh VPNs for secure remote access

## The Capability Lattice™

A new economic coordination primitive that treats urban economies as live optimization surfaces over capabilities rather than static directories. This enables constraint-based discovery and city-scale coordination.

## Technical Specifications

- **Base Models**: Qwen 2.5-Coder-72B, Llama 3.1-70B
